## 0.7.0 – 2025-11-08

### Summary
Laboratory pesticide ingestion arrives with harmonized analyte schema, plus a major expansion in test coverage for `observatory.py` (30% → 81%). This release is additive and non-breaking.

### Added
- `get_pesticide_metabolites(cycle)`: Multi-series (UPHOPM, OPD, PP) NHANES pesticide file discovery & ingestion.
- `load_pesticide_reference()`: Curated reference metadata (CAS RN, matrix, cycle availability) for analytes.
- Log-transformed concentration (`log_concentration`) and detection flag (`detected_flag`) derivations.
- Expanded test suite covering HTML component table parsing, manifest filtering, merged dataset creation, weighted mean logic.

### Documentation
- API reference updated with pesticide laboratory schema details.
- Features page marks pesticide laboratory ingestion as implemented and updates coverage status.
- README "What's New" section includes 0.7.0 changes and revised coverage note.

### Quality & Coverage
- `observatory.py` coverage increased from 30% to 81% via targeted tests.
- Defensive paths (rare HTML anomalies, edge-case error branches) remain partially uncovered; documented as acceptable risk.

### Notes
- Sets foundation for future cross-cycle pesticide analytics and RAG-enhanced contextual question answering.
- No API removals; semantic version bumped MINOR → 0.7.0.

### Upgrade Guidance
Install/upgrade as normal:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pophealth-observatory
```
No code changes required for existing ingestion workflows.
