The 2022 Pesticide Data Program (PDP) annual summary reported that detection frequencies for dimethylphosphate (DMP) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) remained low in most fruit composite samples. 

However, certain citrus matrices exhibited occasional measurable levels of diethylphosphate (DEP) alongside trace permethrin metabolite markers such as cis-DCCA.

Overall dietary exposure estimates for organophosphate metabolites (e.g., DMP, DEP) continue to decline compared to early 2000s baselines. Pyrethroid metabolite 3-PBA trends were stable.
