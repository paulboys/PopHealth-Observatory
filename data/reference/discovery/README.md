# Discovery Reference Placeholder

This directory is reserved for exploratory or provisional pesticide reference assets (e.g., draft mappings, candidate classifications, intermediate similarity outputs).

It is currently empty aside from this placeholder. Tests require its presence to validate expected reference data layout.

When adding discovery artifacts:
- Use clear prefixes: `draft_`, `candidate_`, `exploratory_`
- Include a PROVENANCE block at top of each file
- Never mix provisional data with production minimal/classified references

Until populated, this file ensures the directory is tracked for CI integrity checks.
